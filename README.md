# Pool

Event sourced tournament management application targeted at the local 8/9/10
ball competitions.

## Features

* player registration (possibly including collecting entry fee)
* point allocation based on finish position
* league leaderboard
* fair handicapping based on FargoRate in the form of matches required to win
  or lower entry fees

## Development

This is a highly experiential project where I plan to solve problems in ways I
haven't before, I want to:

* take a functional approach to be enforced with languages and/or frameworks
  (Elixir, Elm / Redux)
* build a minimal CQRS + ES framework in Elixir
* build a divorced client side application (to better understand the trade offs
  with server rendered HTML)
